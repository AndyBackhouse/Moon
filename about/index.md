<p style="text-align: justify;">My work/work site is http://treebark.design. By trade I am a Graphic &amp; Web Designer working in Harrogate. However, I have a prodigious artistic output that I exhibit the Nation over. Most of the work on this site is Sound Based - as in I am an amateur Sound Artist - you will also find dabblings in Radio and Music, Video and Photography. I would write some arty bollocks here, on this site, but I figure that is not what I am about - I do not want to come across as pretentious or lofty - so, I do not write or speak in that way. However, saying that, the stuff I create (if you want to call it art - feel free) seeks to push boundaries of what you think about yourself. I work, primarily with identity. I have lived in just about every corner of the England and have an affinity to many aspects of the places I have lived whilst holding my own identity. This what motivates me.</p>
