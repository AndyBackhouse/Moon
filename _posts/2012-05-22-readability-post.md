Right, where to begin really - see I had a Wordpress Blog and that went down the pan quickly. It took an age to load as I had been blogging for years - four of them to be exact. So, the time lost to a loading screen will be missed. Plus, a lot of the blog was very angsty and teenage - not somethign I would want rpospective employees to come across when they Google me. So, I will be knocking that on the head ASAP.

## Jekyll

I came across a static web site generator called Jekyll - I must have been the last person to reallise it's potential - it is built around the content and nothing more - I now have more say in what my site looks like and can start afresh. The site is hosted on Github.

> The text looks amazing!

I have decided to pool two wordpress sites (my artist site and my personal blog) in to a manageable package under one domain - this one. Hopefully it will last ...
