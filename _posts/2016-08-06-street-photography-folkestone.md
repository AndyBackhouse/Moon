I was invited back in late 2015 to play a Sound Art festival called Plunge, in Folkestone Kent. I believe it was in October of that year. My set went well and I have a recording of it somewhere, but, what stuck with me was the way the light was different down on the South Coast as it is up here in Yorkshire.

Armed with this new outlook I carried a SONY QX10 around with me firing from the hip. Here are some of the images.
